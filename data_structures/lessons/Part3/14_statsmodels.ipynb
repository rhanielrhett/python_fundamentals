    "Okay so we have learned to import, subset, modify, and visualize our data set. But what if we want to perform regression or statistical tests on our data? In this notebook, we introduce `statsmodels`, a package that is useful for statistical analysis in Python. This allows for a lot of statistical models to be developed directly in Python without needing to go to other languages or software. In this section, we will introduce two basic statistical methods available through `statsmodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `statsmodels` uses a lot of calculations and operations from `numpy`. This means, among other things, that it is designed to use with numerical data. If you want to use categorical variables in a model, you will often need to convert those variables from strings to numbers."
