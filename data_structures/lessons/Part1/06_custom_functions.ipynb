    "\n",
    "Function writing is one of the most important skills you can develop as a programmer. However, there is also a lot that can go wrong in the function writing process, leading to time-consuming corrections. Here are some guidelines that can help minimize errors and make the process less painful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan**\n",
    "    1. What is the overall goal of the function? Is there a function that exists already that does the same thing? \n",
    "    2. What is going to be the output of the function? (what data type, how many items)?\n",
    "    3. What arguments will you need? What pieces of the function do you need to control?\n",
    "    4. What are the general steps of the program? This can be written in bullet points or \"pseudocode\".\n",
    "2. **Write**\n",
    "    1. Start by writing the code without the function wrapper.\n",
    "    2. Start small. Write small self-contained blocks of code and put the pieces together. You can also consider sub-functions if it is a particularly complex issue.\n",
    "    3. Test each part of the function as it is added. Track the input of the function and how it changes at each step. \n",
    "    4. Wrap the code in the function syntax.\n",
    "3. **Test**\n",
    "    1. Take the function and test *several* cases.\n",
    "    2. Before running test cases, form an expectation of the result. \n",
    "    3. Test the function. Pay attention to both errors and strange results. Make adjustments to account for new cases.\n",
    "    4. Integrate the function with the rest of the code. Are the input arguments the right type? Does the output flow into the rest of the code?"
