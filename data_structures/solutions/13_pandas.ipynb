    "One intuition may be that different penguin species have different culmen length/depth, resulting in the pattern observed in the scatterplot above. Let's say we want to explore this pattern by plotting the data for each species in a different color. This will allow us to visualize this pattern if it is present in the data.\n",

    "So let's try it! Specifically, we want to visualize the culmen depth vs. the culmen length for each of the penguin species separately. We'll use different colors for each species.\n",

    "To do this, we set the first layer equal to the variable `fig`. This represents our plot. All of our plots thus far have had a single layer. To include multiple layers in a plot, we simply include the argument `ax=fig` in any subsequent layers. This tells `pandas` to put new layers on the original plot rather than to make a new plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to make your own layered visualization!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make three different sub-DataFrames, one for each species, using `.loc[]` and a Boolean mask. (**Hint:** This is the solution to Challenge 3)\n",
    "2. Plot the first layer and set it equal to `fig`.\n",
    "3. Plot subsequent layers. Use a different color for each species (look at the documentation for the name of the color parameter). Some possible colors to use are `'green'`, `'red'`, `'purple'`, `'black'`, etc. (Remember to include the argument `ax=fig`!)\n",
    "4. Do you notice a pattern in culmen measurements based on species? What other elements for the plot would be helpful for interpreting it?\n",

    "**Bonus:** Add a title and any other modifications to the plot (better x and y labels, for example)."
